\begin{abstract}
    As software becomes increasingly complex, the need for robust and correct tests becomes dire. But, how do we generate good tests? What software can we generate good tests for? What does it mean for a test to be good? We survey and reflect on several methods on generating tests from \textit{mathematical and logical abstractions}.
